    <title>The Delta Blues Pantheon, Vol. II: Charley Patton</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthy Neutrals with a Deep Red Accent -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A thematic, non-linear SPA using the same four-section structure as Vol. I for series consistency: The Father (biography/milieu), The Sound (musical deconstruction), The Recordings (interactive discography), and The Legacy (influence). This structure allows users to explore different facets of Patton's dense history at their own pace, transforming a scholarly text into an engaging, explorable narrative. Key interactions include an interactive diagram of Dockery Farms, tabs for his guitar techniques, and a filterable table of his recordings, all designed for discovery. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
    - **Dockery Farms Nexus:** (Organize) -> HTML/CSS Diagram -> Click nodes to reveal musician bios -> Visually organizes the key figures and their relationships better than a list.
    - **Guitar Techniques:** (Explain) -> Interactive HTML/CSS Tabs -> Click to switch between Percussion, Slide, and Tunings -> Breaks down complex technical info into digestible chunks.
    - **Recorded Works:** (Explore Data) -> Filterable HTML Table (JS) -> Users can filter by session or tuning -> Turns a static data table from the report into an interactive research tool.
    - **Influence Map:** (Show Relationships) -> HTML/CSS "Family Tree" Layout -> Hover to highlight connections -> Clearly visualizes his direct and indirect lineage, making his vast influence immediately apparent.

                <p class="text-lg text-stone-600 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center">To understand Charley Patton is to understand the Mississippi Delta at the turn of the 20th century. His life and music were forged in the crucible of sharecropping and Jim Crow, yet it was within this oppressive system that a cultural explosion occurred, with one location serving as its undisputed epicenter: Dockery Farms.</p>

                        <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed">The post-Civil War Delta was a landscape of economic bondage. The sharecropping system trapped families in inescapable cycles of debt, legally binding them to the land. This world of total control was reinforced by the social terror of Jim Crow, creating an environment of profound hardship. Yet, it was from the work songs and field hollers of this oppressive world that a new musical language of resilience and defiance emerged: the blues.</p>

                        <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed">Patton’s own life is shrouded in mystery. His birth year is uncertain, and his mixed Black, White, and Native American heritage placed him in a liminal space. This ambiguity, coupled with a deep conflict between his father's preaching and his own love for the "devil's music," created the complex, larger-than-life persona of the ultimate showman and sinner-preacher.</p>

                 <p class="text-lg text-stone-600 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center">To call Charley Patton's style "primitive" is to miss its genius. He was a master innovator who treated the guitar as a full orchestra and his voice as a force of nature. His sound was a complex tapestry of polyrhythms, percussive attacks, and raw lyrical journalism that set the template for all Delta blues to follow.</p>

                        <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed">Patton's voice was his most powerful instrument. A gravelly, booming shout that could carry 500 yards without amplification, it was a direct descendant of the field holler. He used it as a journalistic tool, documenting the world around him—from the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 in "High Water Everywhere" to local droughts and figures. He was his community's griot, preserving its history in song.</p>

                             <h4 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">The Guitar as a Drum</h4>
                             <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed">Patton played the guitar with a polyrhythmic drive, treating it as a percussion instrument. He would tap on its body to add rhythmic layers and pioneered a percussive "snap" on the bass strings, plucking them so they struck the fretboard for a sharp, aggressive attack. This created a full-band sound from a single instrument.</p>
                         </div>

                              <h4 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">A Voice-like Moan</h4>
                              <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed">He was a master of the slide guitar, using a knife or bottleneck to coax mournful, voice-like sounds from the strings. His control was so precise that even on century-old recordings, his intonation is noted as being "spot on," a testament to his virtuosity and a direct refutation of any notion that his playing was crude.</p>

                              <p class="text-stone-700 leading-relaxed">Patton's mastery of various tunings—including Standard, Open G (Spanish), and Open D (Vestapol)—gave him incredible versatility. He rarely used a capo, instead tuning the entire guitar up to achieve a brighter, more tense sound. This difficult technique allowed him to create a wide range of moods and textures for his diverse repertoire.</p>

Speir, he recorded for Paramount and Vocalion. The Paramount pressings were notoriously poor, yet from these few surviving, battered 78s, a revolution was born. Explore his recorded works below.</p>
